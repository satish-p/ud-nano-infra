Changes made to reduce cost:
============================
using smaller ec2 instance size - t3a.large instead of t3a.xlarge. Instances will be in auto scaling group and based on load from 50000 users no of instances will be scaled down/up, but it is expected to  average out because of nature of social media traffic. For one region, It will peak during few hours but I expect user traffic to be lower for a good part of the day. 

using smaller RDS instance:  For most part of the day services will work but there is a risk of increase in latency during peak load hours.
